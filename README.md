# Tweet_Scraper
Scrapes twitter data.

This script was built to scrape tweets to figure out the most trending company on the NSE (National stock exchange).
Its done by scraping all the tweets belonging to general stock market tags and then counting the number of positive and negetive tweets for the companies being tweeted about.
The positivity or the negetivity of the tweets do not actually matter for this strategy as the most talked abbout stocks are needed so that they can be watched over the trading hours.
The X Path Will change in the future, the script might get redundant.

# Note : It might be difficult to recreate this project as no requirements are provided. The requirements will not be provided, this script is just meant to be stored here, probably will never be used.
